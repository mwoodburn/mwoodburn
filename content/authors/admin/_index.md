## About Me

Welcome to my portfolio. This site details my work and experience from the past two years while completing my MGIST. Take a look through my portfolio to check out some of the projects I've completed in the program as well as work completed during my internship and capstone experience.

I've come a long way from my first map (a section of which is pictured above). As a high school student, I thought I was going to pursue art as a college major and figure out the whole job thing from there. For a project in 11th grade, I quilted and then hand-embroidered a topographic map of the section of the Appalachian Mountains surrounding my grandparents' house in Sylva, NC. I already had a fascination with maps, but that project sparked the idea in my mind that I could combine my artistic and aesthetic talents with my growing interest in geography and data science. After entering UNC Chapel Hill as a studio art major, I quickly changed my program to major in geography, and the rest is history.

I continue to hold value for cartographic endeavors, and I especially enjoy work where I can combine many of my skills and passions: art, data analysis, and coding. I hope you will appreciate my aesthetic sense as you explore my work in this portfolio. Through my time in the program, I have built upon prior education in Geography and Visual Arts from my Undergraduate program, adding a deeper knowledge of GIS concepts and proficiency with ArcGIS programs. For more detailed information about my experience and learning in the program, you can read through my portfolio.
