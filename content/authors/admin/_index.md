## About Me

Welcome to my portfolio. This site details my work and experience from the past two years while completing my MGIST. Take a look through my portfolio to check out some of the projects I've completed in the program as well as work completed during my internship and capstone experience.

I was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I currently live. I received my undergraduate degree in geography from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I worked in a lab studying disease transmission and mitigation, creating data visualizations. I enrolled in the MGIST program to develop my geospatial modeling and analytical abilities and continue creating effective and interesting visualizations. My passions lie with transportation and coding; I have enjoyed working as a GIS intern for the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for planning, where I mainly deal with land use coding, database management, and scripting.

My work in the MGIST program, as shown in this portfolio, has prepared me for a career as a GIS analyst or programmer working in the transportation sector. I am excited for the opportunity to communicate with the public about transportation issues through visualizations, and excited to advance the field of transportation modeling and analysis.
