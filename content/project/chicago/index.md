Vacant lots can be a sign of neighborhood decline; they lower property values and cause dysfunctional neighborhood housing markets. However, these effects are present generally in abandonment demolitions, not teardown demolitions. The spatial variance in characteristics of vacant lots is important for policy decisions, and new uses for vacant lots are emerging. Chicago's Large Lot program allows property owners to purchase vacant lots for as little as $1 given that they maintain the lots. Regreening programs or other temporary uses for vacant lots can increase condition-care and empower residents, but the efficacy depends on the spatial situation and physical characteristics of the lot.

Not all demolition is the same. Teardown demolitions are associated with gentrifying neighborhoods and involve immediate demolition and subsequent construction of new housing stock. These demolitions, done by private owners for profit, revalorize housing stock and land. On the other hand, abandonment or nuisance demolition typically follows a buildingâ€™s becoming uninhabitable. It is not carried out in the pursuit of profit and is done without plans for redevelopment.

While gentrification predicts teardown demolitions in a neighborhood, parcel-level land use data allows the visualization of both teardown and abandonment demolitions. The combination of vacant, vacant city-owned, and under construction land, without any other demographic data, can indicate the type of vacancies and demolitions in an area at the community area level and even within community areas. The Land Use Inventory is much less likely to capture teardown demolitions, which are immediately replaced by fast-moving construction, while vacancies associated with abandonment are evident because of their lasting nature.

Gentrifying communities should be subject to policies regulating developers, such as not allowing parcel assemblage for new construction or charging fees for demolition permits. Neighborhoods experiencing long-term vacancy are generally suited to the Large Lot program. Greening initiatives can be helpful, but may be less effective for extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods. Provisional solutions are also appropriate for continuously vacant land because, evidently, the value of the land is impermanent; the land is not currently producing capital.
