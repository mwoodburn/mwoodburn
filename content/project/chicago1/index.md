Not all demolition is the same. Teardown demolitions are associated with gentrifying neighborhoods and involve immediate demolition and subsequent construction of new housing stock. Carried out by private owners for profit, they revalorize housing stock and land. Abandonment or nuisance demolition typically follows a buildingâ€™s becoming uninhabitable. It is not carried out in the pursuit of profit and is done without plans for redevelopment. Gentrifying communities should be subject to policies regulating developers, such as not allowing parcel assemblage for new construction or charging fees for demolition permits. Provisional solutions are also appropriate for continuously vacant land because, evidently, the value of the land is impermanent; the land is not currently producing capital.

This visualization uses the 2020 Land Use Inventory (LUI) to show patterns of demolition and reconstruction using vacant, vacant city-owned, and under construction parcels. I worked on the 2023 LUI during my internship at CMAP and wanted to use the dataset to show phenomena in Chicago relating to vacant land.
