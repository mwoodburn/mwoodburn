In this analysis, I used a cost surface to map walking time to the nearest bus stop. The cost surface is based on a land cover raster combined with street raster, with walking times assigned to each land cover, including streets. The map shows pedestrian isochrones and identifies areas within the borough where one would have a significant walk to a bus stop.
