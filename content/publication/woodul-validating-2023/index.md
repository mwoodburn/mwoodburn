abstract: As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, various models have been developed
  to forecast changes in the outbreak and assess intervention strategies. In this
  study we validate the Simulator of Infectious Disease Dynamics in North Carolina
  (SIDD-NC) model against an ensemble of proxy-ground truth infections datasets. We
  assess the performance of SIDD-NC using Spearman Rank Correlation, RMSE, and percent
  RMSE at a state and county level. We conduct the analysis for the period of March
  2020 through November 2020 as well as in shorter time increments to assess both
  the recreation of the pandemic curve as well as day-to-day transmission of SARS-CoV-2
  within the population. We find that SIDD-NC performs well against the datasets in
  the ensemble, generating an estimate of infections that is robust both spatially
  and temporally.
